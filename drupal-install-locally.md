## Overview of the Learn Drupal Ladder

In this series we introduce the Drupal Ladder project, and walk through the lessons in the Drupal ladder. This community initiative was created to get more people to help with work on Drupal core. It achieves this by creating lessons that start with the very basic skills needed to help and working their way up the ladder into more skills and tasks. Our series begins with a short presentation about the project, and then the subsequent videos walk through the lessons from the ladder, starting with installing Drupal locally.

## Install Drupal Locally with Dev Desktop

In this first step of the Learn Drupal Ladder we will install Drupal on our computer. This follows the instructions to Install Drupal locally on learndrupal.org. We start by getting and installing the Dev Desktop, which is an all-in-one web server which comes with Drupal 7. We then install our own Drupal 8 site in Dev Desktop.

If you do not wish to use Dev Desktop as your local web server, we have videos for three other web servers, based on operating system:

* Installing WampServer (for Windows)
* Installing MAMP web server (for Mac)
* Installing a web server on Ubuntu
