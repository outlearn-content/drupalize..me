In this step we turn our attention to Drupal.org and the community issue queue. This is where all of the active work for Drupal core takes place. We will look at the queue and create our issue to see how it works. This video follows the instructions for the [Getting started in the issue queue lesson](http://drupalladder.org/lesson/1d498fa2-d3e4-5754-9160-757d219e8032) on learndrupal.org.
