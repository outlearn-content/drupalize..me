In this first step of the Learn Drupal Ladder we will install Drupal on our computer. This follows the instructions to [Install Drupal locally](http://drupalladder.org/lesson/8daa1222-481d-fc54-a9bf-9d9ccc1ae702) on learndrupal.org. We start by getting and installing the [Dev Desktop](http://www.acquia.com/products-services/dev-desktop), which is an all-in-one web server which comes with Drupal 7. We then install our own Drupal 8 site in Dev Desktop.

If you do not wish to use Dev Desktop as your local web server, we have videos for three other web servers, based on operating system:
